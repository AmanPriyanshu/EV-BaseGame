## Defining agent inputs:

```py
{
	"prev_direction" : options ("north", "south", "west", "east") --> default ("north")
	"moving" : options (0 - `previously_at_rest`, 1 - `previously_moving`) --> default (0)
	"x" : range (0, WIDTH)
	"y" : range (0, HEIGHT)
	"surround_space_pixel_00" --> options (0 - `empty space`, 1 - `map_border`, 2 - `another_bot`) --> default (0)
	...
	"surround_space_pixel_13" --> options (0 - `empty space`, 1 - `map_border`, 2 - `another_bot`) --> default (0)
	...
	"surround_space_pixel_44" --> options (0 - `empty space`, 1 - `map_border`, 2 - `another_bot`) --> default (0)
}
```

The model basically receives a total of 2 (self-based) + 2 (global) + 24 (surroundings) --> 28 inputs.

## Defining agent outputs:

```py
{
	"next_move" : options ("rest", "forward", "left", "right", "backward")
}
```

The output must be a single probability distributions allowing the individual to make the next move. --> SOFTMAX (5 neurons in the output wing)

## Inner Neurons:

```py
// TO BE DEFINED
```

## Understanding the genomics:

Input context - 24 `input_variables` and 5 `output_variables`. Reconstituting the individual inputs to be representable.

`24 input_variables` --> closest 2 power is `32` --> basically `val=(00000)` to restrict space, to the 24 possible inputs, we mod val with 24 (`val%24`). Can extend by 8 new inputs.

`5 output_variables` --> closest 2 power is `8` --> basically `out=(000)` to restrict space, to the 5 possible inputs, we mod val with 5 (`out%5`). Can extend by 3 new outputs.

Now we want float values to represent the passing weights between the inputs/outputs. Lets begin understanding the sensitivity of the softmax function, we can simply extend the sigmoid function's sensitive to approximate softmax, as sigmoid is simply limited softmax.

Looking at the graph, it should be substantial to consider upto 3 decimal places `._ _ _` at the same time, a bar between `[-4, 4]` should be sufficient. Therefore we need to find a numeric range constituting an integer space âˆˆ `[0, 8000] ~ [0, 8192) = [0, 2^13)`. It will then be normalized as `(value-4096)/1000`.

```
| 0 | 00000 | 000 | 0-000-000-000-000 |
```
basically a total of `(1+5+3+13)=22` stream of binaries.

### Representation:

Although this isn't an essential representations are essential for visualizations. So lets discuss representations, now human DNA is represented by:

```md
1. adenine (A) - 00
2. guanine (G) - 01
3. cytosine (C) - 10
4. thymine (T) - 11
```

Basically it can encode two bins (`00`). So, we can represent our entire stream by a stream of 11 (`A/G/C/T`). Colour representation - pixel colours are an interesting aspect of visulaization so, what we do is represent them by `RGB=[0,256)`, therefore we can extend our stream of `22 bins` by `2 bins`, making it `24 bins`. Divide it into `8-8-8 bins` allowing us to compute RGB values.
